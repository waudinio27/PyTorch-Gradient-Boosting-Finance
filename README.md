# PyTorch-Gradient-Boosting-Finance
Inspired by https://sarem-seitz.com/posts/with-pytorch-i-can-gradient-boost-anything.html I have built a Gradient Boosting Machine in a similar approach. I have to get deeper into the theory to know if the forecasting is appropriate and also want to add fourier transform features.
